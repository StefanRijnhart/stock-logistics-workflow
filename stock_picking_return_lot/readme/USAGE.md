To use this module, go to a done receipt or delivery in the inventory, and click
the Return button. Odoo will show all products without lines or lots.

If you click the 'Return All' button here, this module will ensure that the
originally transferred lots and serials are applied automatically to the resulting
return transfer.

You can also choose to return only part of the original transfer and enter
quantities yourself, before clicking the 'Return' button. This module helps you to
determine what can be transferred by adding the 'Set Quantities' button, which will
update the lines on the screen with the quantities that are still available to
return per lot (the original quantities minus any quantities that were returned
earlier).

If you try to accept returns for lots that were not originally transferred, or
exceed the originally transferred quantities, this module will show an error
message.
