To use this module, go to a done receipt or delivery in the inventory, and click
the Return button. Odoo will show all products with the originally transferred
quantity per lot (minus any quantities that were transferred earlier).

If you click the 'Return All' button here, this module will ensure that the
originally transferred lots and serials are applied automatically to the resulting
return transfer.

You can also choose to return only part of the original transfer and update the
quantities here, before clicking the 'Return' button. If the picking type of the
original transfer was marked to restrict returned quantities, you will not be
allowed to enter a higher quantity than is available to return.
